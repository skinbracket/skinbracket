 ----- FAQ : <br>
**How do I vote?**
<br> focus on each individual pair, ([CLICK TO ZOOM IN ON PAIR ONE](https://rentry.co/skinbracket2)) <br> then select your preferred option by typing either 'A' or 'B' in [this atabook](https://skinbracket2025.atabook.org/). <br>'A' and 'B' represent one of the two participants, and your selection will be counted as your vote :-) <br>

**What about other contestants?**
<br> youll be able to vote for contestants from the second bracket some time later.
<br> I'll be taking google forms until i get 16 participants for bonus round! <br>
