FAQ<br>
**What is pt skin bracket?**<br>
a bracket tournament for pony town users to rank skins made by other users<br>

**How do i submit my skin?**<br>
**[via google form](https://forms.gle/v3buJfoqn8DBgWoRA)** thats only available until july 20th!<br>
upload your skin on [catbox](https://catbox.moe/) (or anywhere else) and paste the link there <br>

**How do i vote?**<br>
voting will take place through atabook - to avoid people rigging the votes. after the bracket is finished the atabook will be deleted! all votes WILL remain anonymous; as no messages will show up on main page. you will be blocked from leaving a message after you cast your vote so CHOOSE WISELY. vpn messages will NOT work. <br>

**When will the first round voting start?**<br>
somewhere between july 22nd-24th - everyone will be paired in submission order; if it ends up as an odd number, the last person will have to be cut off from participating. next voting will take place 2 days after the previous one. <br>
